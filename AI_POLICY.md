# AI Policy

Follow [MapLibre's AI Policy](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre/blob/main/AI_POLICY.md) and the
guidance below for this repository.

## Stay in the loop

Before you mark a pull request ready for review:

- Read every line you are asking maintainers to merge.
- Be able to explain the change, how it fits the codebase, and how you validated it—without leaning
  on the tool to answer review questions.
- Write the PR description yourself: motivation, approach, impact, and anything you are unsure
  about. Spell-checking or translation help is fine; the ideas and structure should be yours.

Design the change. Use AI to draft, explore, or speed up typing—not to replace understanding the
problem or the existing code.

## Talk to maintainers in your own voice

Issues, PR bodies, and review replies are a conversation between humans. Write them yourself.

- State problems and proposals in your own words.
- When a maintainer asks a question, answer from your understanding. Do not paste model output as
  your reply.
- Trim verbosity. Say what matters for the review.

If you used AI to polish English, read the result once and adjust it so it sounds like you. For
translation, writing in your native language and adding an English version in a quote block works
well.

## When AI context belongs in a thread

Sometimes a snippet from an AI session helps reviewers (for example, a design option you rejected).
Share it in a way that keeps the thread readable:

- **A few lines:** Put them in a quote block (`>`), label them as AI-generated, and add a short note
  in your own words on why they are relevant.
- **More than a few lines:** Put the full text in a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) (or
  similar) and link it. In the comment, summarize in your own words what the gist contains and what
  you want reviewers to take from it.

Do not post long, unedited AI output in issues or pull requests without maintainer approval.

## Disclosure

When disclosure applies under MapLibre's policy, fill in the **AI assistance** section of the pull
request template. Disclosure is not penalized.

When planning docs guided the work, commit them on your branch as you go. Removing them before merge
is fine; reviewers can still follow the process in the commit history. Point to the relevant commits
or paths in **Context** when that history matters for review.
